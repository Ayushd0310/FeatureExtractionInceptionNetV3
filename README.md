## About

This repository contains code and resources for a Brain Tumor image classification project using the InceptionNet V3 architecture, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature reduction, and Fuzzy Logic algorithm for decision-making. The goal of this project is to accurately classify brain tumor images into different categories (e.g., malignant, benign, etc.) to aid in medical diagnosis.
